Chicken $1.59
Beef $1.99
Cheese $1.00
Milk $2.50

Next is updating existing values in a dictionary. To update the value for a given key we use the same bracket notation approach and variable reassignment. We can either replace the value entirely or modify it using arithmetic operators. Using the same NBA_players dictionary as an example, what if I wanted to change Lebronâ€™s jersey number to 6, which was his number during his time in Miami? 

Jordan 13,  1
Yeezy, 8
Foamposite, 10
Air Max, 5
SB Dunk, 20

Update your new dictionary and its stored values based on the prompts below and print your results:
- A customer came in to purchase 2 pairs of  SB Dunks
- A customer came in to return a pair of Yeezys
- The store got a new shipment. All stock increases by 7.
- There is a special sale at the store. All stock decreases by 3.
